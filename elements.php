            <p>
              Pharmacovigilance is the science and activities related to the detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention
              of adverse effects or any other drug-related problems. It ensures patient safety and improves public health outcomes.

            <p>
              Clinical trials are structured research studies conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs, treatments,
              or medical devices in human participants, following strict regulatory guidelines and ethical standards.
